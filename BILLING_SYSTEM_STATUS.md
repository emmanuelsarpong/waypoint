## ‚ö†Ô∏è REMAINING TASKS FOR FULL PRODUCTION

### 1. Stripe Customer Portal Configuration

**Issue**: The "Manage Subscription" button may show an error about portal not being configured.

**Solution Required**:

1. Log into your Stripe Dashboard
2. Go to Settings ‚Üí Billing Portal
3. Configure the Customer Portal settings:
   - Allowed features (cancel subscriptions, update payment methods, etc.)
   - Branding and appearance
   - Terms and privacy policy links
4. Activate the portal

### 2. Stripe Webhook Endpoint in Production

**Current**: Using ngrok URL `https://1598-70-24-228-252.ngrok-free.app/api/billing/webhook`

**For Production**:

1. Update Stripe Dashboard webhook endpoint to your production domain
2. Update `.env` with the new webhook secret from production endpoint
3. Ensure webhook events are configured for:
   - `checkout.session.completed`
   - `customer.subscription.deleted`
   - `invoice.payment_succeeded`

### 3. Frontend Authentication State

**Potential Issue**: Users returning from Stripe Customer Portal may need to refresh to see updated UI.

**Verification Needed**:

1. Test the complete flow: Login ‚Üí Subscribe ‚Üí Manage Subscription ‚Üí Return to app
2. Ensure UI updates correctly without requiring page refresh
3. Check that subscription status is properly reflected in the frontend
