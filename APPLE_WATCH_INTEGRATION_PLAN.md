# Apple Watch Integration - System Architecture

## 🎯 Overview

You now have a **complete Strava-like fitness tracking system** ready for Apple Watch integration! Here's what we've built:

## 🏗️ Current Architecture

### **Frontend (Web App)**

- **`AdvancedMap.jsx`** - Strava-like route visualization with:
  - Interactive map showing saved workouts
  - Route filtering by sport (running, cycling, hiking)
  - Clickable routes with detailed stats overlay
  - Route creation and saving functionality
  - Professional UI with sport-specific colors

### **Backend API**

- **`/api/workouts`** endpoints for your Apple Watch app:
  - `POST /api/workouts` - Save new workout from watch
  - `GET /api/workouts` - Get user's saved workouts
  - `GET /api/workouts/stats` - Get aggregate statistics
  - `PUT /api/workouts/:id` - Update workout details
  - `DELETE /api/workouts/:id` - Delete workouts

### **Data Structure** (Ready for Apple Watch)

```json
{
  "name": "Morning Run",
  "sport": "running|cycling|hiking|walking",
  "startTime": "2025-06-28T08:00:00Z",
  "endTime": "2025-06-28T08:30:00Z",
  "coordinates": [
    {
      "lat": 45.5017,
      "lng": -73.5673,
      "timestamp": "2025-06-28T08:00:00Z",
      "elevation": 50,
      "speed": 12.5,
      "heartRate": 150
    }
  ],
  "stats": {
    "distance": 5.2,
    "duration": 1800,
    "avgPace": "5:45",
    "elevationGain": 120,
    "calories": 350,
    "avgHeartRate": 150,
    "steps": 6800
  },
  "source": "apple_watch"
}
```

## 📱 Apple Watch App Development Plan

### **Phase 1: Basic Apple Watch App**

```swift
// WatchKit app with HealthKit integration
import HealthKit
import CoreLocation
import WatchConnectivity

class WorkoutManager: NSObject, ObservableObject {
    let healthStore = HKHealthStore()
    let locationManager = CLLocationManager()

    // Start GPS workout recording
    func startWorkout(activityType: HKWorkoutActivityType) {
        // Record GPS coordinates, heart rate, calories
    }

    // Save completed workout to your backend
    func saveWorkout(workoutData: WorkoutData) {
        // POST to http://your-backend.com/api/workouts
    }
}
```

### **Phase 2: iOS Companion App**

- **Sync with Apple Watch** when out of range
- **Upload workouts** to your backend API
- **View routes** on phone before they appear on web

### **Phase 3: Advanced Features**

- **Real-time tracking** (watch → phone → web live updates)
- **Route recommendations** based on past activities
- **Social features** (share routes, challenges)

## 🔌 Apple Watch Integration Points

### **1. Workout Recording (Apple Watch)**

```swift
// Sample Apple Watch code structure
import HealthKit

class WatchWorkoutManager {
    func recordWorkout() {
        // Start HKWorkoutSession
        // Track GPS with CLLocationManager
        // Monitor heart rate with HKHealthStore
        // Calculate pace, distance in real-time
    }

    func finishWorkout() -> WorkoutData {
        // Process GPS points
        // Calculate final stats
        // Return structured data for your API
    }
}
```

### **2. Data Sync (iPhone)**

```swift
// Send workout to your backend
func uploadWorkout(_ workout: WorkoutData) {
    guard let url = URL(string: "http://localhost:3000/api/workouts") else { return }

    var request = URLRequest(url: url)
    request.httpMethod = "POST"
    request.setValue("Bearer \(userToken)", forHTTPHeaderField: "Authorization")
    request.setValue("application/json", forHTTPHeaderField: "Content-Type")

    let jsonData = try? JSONEncoder().encode(workout)
    request.httpBody = jsonData

    URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: request) { data, response, error in
        // Handle response
    }.resume()
}
```

### **3. Web Display (Already Built!)**

Your `AdvancedMap.jsx` will automatically show:

- Routes recorded by Apple Watch
- Detailed workout statistics
- Interactive route visualization
- Sport-specific filtering and colors

## 🚀 Next Steps

### **Immediate (Backend Complete)**

1. ✅ **Backend API** - Ready for Apple Watch integration
2. ✅ **Web visualization** - Displays routes beautifully
3. ✅ **Authentication** - Secure user workout data

### **Apple Watch Development**

1. **Create Xcode project** with WatchKit app target
2. **Add HealthKit permissions** for heart rate, workouts
3. **Implement GPS tracking** with CoreLocation
4. **Build workout recording UI** (start/stop/pause)
5. **Add data sync** to your existing backend API

### **Testing the Current System**

You can test the workout API right now:

```bash
# 1. Start your backend (already running)
npm run backend

# 2. Start your frontend
npm run dev

# 3. Login to your app, go to Map page
# 4. Create a route by clicking on the map
# 5. Click "Save Route" - it will save to your backend!
# 6. Refresh the page - saved routes load from backend
```

## 💡 Key Benefits

✅ **Production-ready backend** for Apple Watch integration  
✅ **Professional web interface** like Strava  
✅ **Scalable data structure** supporting all fitness metrics  
✅ **Authentication system** for secure user data  
✅ **Real-time statistics** and route visualization

Your system is now **ready for Apple Watch development**! The backend infrastructure is complete, and your web app will automatically display any workouts recorded by your future Apple Watch app.

## 🎯 Apple Watch App Feasibility

**Not too ambitious at all!** You have:

- ✅ Backend infrastructure ready
- ✅ Web visualization complete
- ✅ Data models defined
- ✅ API endpoints functional

The Apple Watch app is now just a **client** that records GPS data and sends it to your existing system. This is a very achievable next step!
