# Stripe Billing System - Complete Implementation & Testing Guide

## üéØ What We've Implemented

### ‚úÖ Smart Email Notifications

- **Initial subscriptions** - Welcome email with plan details

- **Professional HTML templates** with next billing date and recurring info

### ‚úÖ Subscription Management

- **Automatic cancellation** of previous subscriptions when switching plans

Processing subscription update for user: user@example.com
‚úÖ Plan change notification sent to: user@example.com
```

### Test Webhook Locally

Use Stripe CLI to forward webhooks to your local server:

```bash
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/billing/webhook
```

### Check Email Configuration

```bash
# Test email endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/billing/test-plan-change-email \\
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \\
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```
