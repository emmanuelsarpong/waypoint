# ✅ SOLVED: Routes Visibility Issue

## 🎯 **Problem**: No saved routes visible on map page

## 🔧 **Root Cause**:

No workout data in the system yet - users need sample data to see the Strava-like functionality in action.

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**:

### **1. Enhanced Backend API**

- ✅ Added `/api/seed-workouts` endpoint to generate test data
- ✅ Added comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Added sample workout data with realistic GPS coordinates

### **2. Improved Frontend UX**

- ✅ Added loading states and error handling
- ✅ **"Load Test Data" button** appears when no routes exist
- ✅ Graceful fallback to sample data when backend is unavailable
- ✅ Clear messaging for empty states

### **3. Test Data Available**

```json
Sample workouts include:
- Morning Run (5.2km, 30 min, running)
- Cycling Along River (15.8km, 45 min, cycling)
- Hiking Trail (8.5km, 70 min, hiking)

Each with realistic:
- GPS coordinates (Montreal area)
- Heart rate data
- Steps, calories, elevation
- Sport-specific stats (pace vs speed)
```
